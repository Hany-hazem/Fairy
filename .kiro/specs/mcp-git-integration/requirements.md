4. WHEN MCP messages are received THEN the system SHALL validate message format and route to appropriate handlers
5. WHEN MCP server encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide detailed error messages and maintain system stability
6. WHEN multiple agents connect THEN the system SHALL manage concurrent connections efficiently

### Requirement 2: MCP Client Integration

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to connect to and communicate through MCP, so that I can share context and coordinate with other agents in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent initializes THEN it SHALL establish an MCP client connection to the server
2. WHEN sending messages THEN the agent SHALL format messages according to MCP protocol standards
3. WHEN receiving context updates THEN the agent SHALL process and integrate the information appropriately
4. WHEN connection is lost THEN the agent SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
5. WHEN message delivery fails THEN the agent SHALL handle failures gracefully and retry when appropriate
6. WHEN agent shuts down THEN it SHALL properly close MCP connections and clean up resources

### Requirement 3: Redis Integration for MCP

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want MCP to use Redis as the message broker, so that the system can handle high-throughput message passing with persistence and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP server starts THEN it SHALL connect to Redis and establish message channels
2. WHEN messages are sent THEN they SHALL be queued in Redis with appropriate persistence settings
3. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the failure gracefully and attempt reconnection
4. WHEN message queues grow large THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate queue management strategies
5. WHEN system restarts THEN it SHALL recover pending messages from Redis queues
6. WHEN Redis memory is low THEN the system SHALL implement message expiration and cleanup policies

### Requirement 4: Automated Git Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want every task completion to automatically create a Git commit with proper documentation, so that all development progress is tracked and documented in version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is started THEN the system SHALL create a feature branch with a descriptive name
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL stage the changes automatically
3. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL create a commit with a detailed message including task description and changes
4. WHEN multiple files are modified THEN the system SHALL group related changes into logical commits
5. WHEN commit fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
6. WHEN task involves multiple commits THEN the system SHALL maintain a clean commit history

### Requirement 5: Git Integration with Task Management

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want Git commits to be linked to specific tasks and requirements, so that I can track development progress and maintain traceability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating commits THEN the system SHALL include task IDs and requirement references in commit messages
2. WHEN a task spans multiple commits THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent task tracking across commits
3. WHEN viewing Git history THEN users SHALL be able to trace commits back to specific tasks and requirements
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide task completion statistics based on Git history
5. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on resolving conflicts while maintaining task traceability
6. WHEN branches are merged THEN the system SHALL update task status and close completed tasks

### Requirement 6: MCP Message Types and Routing

**User Story:** As an AI agent developer, I want standardized message types and routing for MCP communication, so that agents can communicate effectively with clear protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining message types THEN the system SHALL implement standard MCP message formats for context sharing, task coordination, and status updates
2. WHEN routing messages THEN the system SHALL direct messages to appropriate agents based on message type and content
3. WHEN agents register THEN they SHALL specify which message types they can handle
4. WHEN message routing fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and error handling
5. WHEN new message types are added THEN the system SHALL support dynamic registration and routing
6. WHEN debugging communication THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging of message flows

### Requirement 7: Context Synchronization via MCP

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to synchronize my context with other agents through MCP, so that we can work collaboratively with shared understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context changes THEN the agent SHALL broadcast relevant context updates via MCP
2. WHEN receiving context updates THEN the agent SHALL merge new information with existing context
3. WHEN context conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms
4. WHEN context becomes stale THEN the system SHALL implement context refresh and validation
5. WHEN agents join or leave THEN the system SHALL synchronize context appropriately
6. WHEN context is large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient context sharing strategies

### Requirement 8: Git Workflow Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated Git workflows that handle branching, committing, and merging based on task lifecycle, so that version control is seamless and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new feature THEN the system SHALL create a feature branch from the main branch
2. WHEN task is in progress THEN the system SHALL make incremental commits with meaningful messages
3. WHEN task is completed THEN the system SHALL prepare the branch for merge with proper documentation
4. WHEN multiple developers work on the project THEN the system SHALL handle merge conflicts intelligently
5. WHEN code review is required THEN the system SHALL create pull requests with comprehensive descriptions
6. WHEN hotfixes are needed THEN the system SHALL create hotfix branches and manage emergency deployments

### Requirement 9: MCP Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want MCP implementation to handle high message volumes and multiple concurrent agents efficiently, so that the system can scale with growing usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN message volume is high THEN the system SHALL maintain low latency and high throughput
2. WHEN many agents are connected THEN the system SHALL manage connections efficiently without resource exhaustion
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate load balancing and queuing strategies
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on message processing times and queue depths
5. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support distributed MCP server deployment
6. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL implement caching and message batching where appropriate

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for both MCP and Git operations, so that the system remains stable and reliable under various failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
2. WHEN Git operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
3. WHEN Redis becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages locally and sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN disk space is low THEN the system SHALL handle Git operations gracefully and warn users
5. WHEN network partitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain local functionality and sync when connectivity is restored
6. WHEN system crashes THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully and resume operations from the last known good state
