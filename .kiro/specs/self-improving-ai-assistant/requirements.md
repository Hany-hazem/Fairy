# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an AI agent and personal assistant that connects to OpenAI/GPT-OSS-20B running on LM Studio (localhost:1234). The system will have self-improvement capabilities, allowing it to analyze and enhance its own code while testing its functionality to ensure reliability and performance improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with an AI personal assistant through a conversational interface, so that I can get help with various tasks and queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a text query THEN the system SHALL forward the request to the LM Studio endpoint at localhost:1234
2. WHEN the LM Studio API responds THEN the system SHALL return the response to the user in a readable format
3. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message to the user
4. WHEN a user starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain context throughout the session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI assistant to remember our conversation history, so that it can provide contextually relevant responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends multiple messages in a session THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
2. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL use vector embeddings to find relevant previous interactions
3. WHEN the context becomes too large THEN the system SHALL intelligently summarize or truncate older messages
4. WHEN a new session starts THEN the system SHALL optionally load relevant context from previous sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI agent to analyze its own code performance and identify improvement opportunities, so that the system can evolve and become more efficient over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs for a defined period THEN it SHALL analyze response times, error rates, and resource usage
2. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log specific metrics and potential improvement areas
3. WHEN code analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL examine its own source code for optimization opportunities
4. WHEN improvements are identified THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with specific recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI agent to automatically test proposed code improvements, so that changes are validated before implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code improvements are proposed THEN the system SHALL create a test environment to validate changes
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute existing test suites against the modified code
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL measure performance improvements compared to the baseline
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL revert changes and log the failure reasons
5. WHEN improvements are validated THEN the system SHALL create a backup of the current version before applying changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI agent to safely apply validated improvements to its own codebase, so that the system continuously evolves without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN improvements are validated THEN the system SHALL create a rollback point before applying changes
2. WHEN applying changes THEN the system SHALL update code files incrementally with proper version control
3. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL restart relevant services gracefully
4. WHEN the system restarts THEN it SHALL verify all functionality is working correctly
5. IF any issues are detected after changes THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the AI assistant's connection to LM Studio, so that I can customize the model settings and endpoint configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the connection THEN the system SHALL allow setting the LM Studio endpoint URL
2. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL allow specifying model parameters like temperature and max tokens
3. WHEN testing the connection THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity to the LM Studio endpoint
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate settings before applying them
5. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and suggested fixes
