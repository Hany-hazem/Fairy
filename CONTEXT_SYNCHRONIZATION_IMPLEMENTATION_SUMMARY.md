# Context Synchronization Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 4 "Create Context Synchronization Engine" from the MCP Git Integration specification. This implementation provides comprehensive context sharing mechanisms and notification systems for agent communication.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Context Synchronizer (`app/context_synchronizer.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Context Broadcasting System**: Enables agents to broadcast context updates to relevant subscribers
- **Context Versioning**: Tracks context versions and detects conflicts
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies version, data, access, and timestamp conflicts
- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
  - Latest Wins: Uses timestamp-based resolution
  - Merge Recursive: Intelligently merges context data
  - Source Priority: Prioritizes local context
  - Field-Level Merge: Merges at individual field level
- **Context Caching**: Optimizes performance with TTL-based caching
- **Access Control**: Respects context access levels and permissions

**Core Methods:**
- `broadcast_context_update()`: Broadcast context to multiple agents
- `sync_agent_context()`: Synchronize context for specific agent
- `resolve_context_conflict()`: Resolve conflicts using configured strategies
- `get_shared_context()`: Retrieve shared context with access control
- `subscribe_to_context_updates()`: Subscribe to context updates

### 2. Context Notification System (`app/context_notification_system.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Flexible Subscription Management**: Support for multiple subscription types
- **Multiple Delivery Methods**:
  - Push: Real-time notifications via callbacks or Redis pub/sub
  - Pull: Agent polls for pending notifications
  - Batch: Efficient batched delivery
  - Webhook: HTTP webhook delivery (framework ready)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Context type, agent, access level, and field-based filtering
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions and access rules
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Message deduplication
  - Compression for large payloads
  - Queue size management
  - Background processing

**Core Methods:**
- `subscribe_to_context_updates()`: Create subscriptions with filtering
- `notify_context_update()`: Send notifications to subscribers
- `get_pending_notifications()`: Retrieve notifications (pull method)
- `create_notification_batch()`: Create batched notifications
- `set_access_control_rules()`: Configure access permissions

### 3. Integration Tests (`tests/test_context_synchronization.py`)

**Test Coverage:**
- Context synchronizer initialization and lifecycle
- Context broadcasting and synchronization
- Conflict detection and resolution strategies
- Subscription management and filtering
- Notification delivery methods
- Access control and permissions
- Performance and caching features

### 4. Demonstration (`examples/context_synchronization_demo.py`)

**Demo Scenarios:**
- Context sharing between agents
- Conflict resolution with different strategies
- Notification system with push and batch delivery
- Access control with different permission levels

## Integration Points

### Redis Backend Integration
- Uses existing `RedisMCPBackend` for message persistence
- Pub/sub for real-time notifications
- Key-value storage for context persistence
- TTL-based expiration management

### MCP Message System Integration
- Compatible with existing MCP message types
- Uses `AgentContext` model from MCP models
- Integrates with MCP routing system
- Follows MCP protocol standards

## Usage Examples

### Basic Context Sharing
```python
# Create context synchronizer
synchronizer = ContextSynchronizer()
await synchronizer.start()

# Broadcast context update
context = AgentContext(
    agent_id="ai_assistant",
    context_type="task_context",
    context_data={"task_id": "123", "status": "completed"}
)

result = await synchronizer.broadcast_context_update(context)
print(f"Broadcast to {len(result.successful_deliveries)} agents")
```

### Subscription Management
```python
# Create notification system
notification_system = ContextNotificationSystem()
await notification_system.start()

# Subscribe to context updates
filter_criteria = SubscriptionFilter(context_types=["task_context"])
subscription_id = await notification_system.subscribe_to_context_updates(
    "self_improvement_agent",
    SubscriptionType.CONTEXT_TYPE,
    filter_criteria
)
```

### Conflict Resolution
```python
# Resolve conflicts automatically
conflicts = await synchronizer.get_active_conflicts()
for conflict in conflicts:
    resolution = await synchronizer.resolve_context_conflict([conflict])
    if resolution.resolved:
        print(f"Conflict resolved using {resolution.resolution_strategy}")
```
