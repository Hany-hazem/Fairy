### Key Configuration Options:
```python
RedisConfig(
    url="redis://localhost:6379",
    max_connections=20,
    password=None,  # Optional authentication
    ssl_enabled=False,  # SSL support
    health_check_interval=30,
    max_retries=3,
    exponential_backoff=True
)
```

## Task 3.2: Redis Pub/Sub Message System ✅ COMPLETED

### Enhanced Pub/Sub Features Implemented:

1. **Real-time Message Delivery**
   - Standard topic subscriptions
   - Pattern-based subscriptions with wildcards (* and ?)
   - Multiple topic subscriptions with single callback
   - Asynchronous message processing

2. **Message Persistence and Replay**
   - Automatic message storage for replay capability
   - Priority queue support with message ordering
   - Message history retrieval with configurable limits
   - Chronological and priority-based message ordering

3. **Advanced Message Filtering**
   - Subscription-level message filtering
   - Support for complex filter criteria ($in, $regex, $gt, $lt)
   - Nested payload filtering (e.g., "payload.task_id")
   - Real-time filter application during message delivery

4. **Message Expiration and Cleanup**
   - Automatic message expiration based on TTL
   - Comprehensive cleanup for all queue types (lists, sorted sets, hashes)
   - Background cleanup workers
   - Memory usage monitoring and optimization

### Enhanced Queue Management:

1. **Priority Queue System**
   - Messages stored in Redis sorted sets by priority
   - High-priority message retrieval
   - Priority-based message ordering
   - Configurable priority levels

2. **Dead Letter Queue**
   - Failed message storage and retry logic
   - Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
   - Failed message replay functionality
   - Automatic cleanup of expired failed messages

3. **Message Deduplication**
   - Hash-based message deduplication
   - Configurable deduplication TTL
   - Prevention of duplicate message processing

4. **Batch Operations**
   - Batch message publishing for improved performance
   - Redis pipeline usage for atomic operations
   - Batch statistics and success tracking

### Key Queue Configuration:
```python
MessageQueueConfig(
    default_ttl=3600,
    max_queue_size=10000,
    priority_queue_enabled=True,
    dead_letter_queue_enabled=True,
    message_deduplication=True,
    max_retry_attempts=3
)
```
