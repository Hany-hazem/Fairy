## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Python 3.10+ installed
- [ ] Git configured with your credentials
- [ ] Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- [ ] Basic understanding of async/await in Python

### Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd personal-assistant-enhancement
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Verify setup
python -m pytest tests/test_multi_modal_simple.py -v

# 4. Start development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### First Steps
- [ ] Read [[project-overview-complete]]
- [ ] Run the test suite and understand the structure
- [ ] Explore the main components in `app/` directory
- [ ] Set up your development environment
- [ ] Join team communication channels

## üéì Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Multi-Modal Interaction
Users can interact through **voice**, **text**, or **visual** interfaces seamlessly. The system preserves context when switching between modes.

**Example**: User starts typing ‚Üí gets text completions ‚Üí switches to voice ‚Üí asks question ‚Üí gets visual and spoken response.

### 2. Privacy-First Architecture
All user data stays local with explicit consent for each operation. Users have complete control over their data.

### 3. Capability Modules
Each major feature (file access, voice processing, screen monitoring) is a separate, testable module that can be enabled/disabled independently.

### 4. Context Awareness
The assistant understands what you're working on and provides relevant help based on your current activity, files, and applications.

### 5. Accessibility-First Design
Built-in support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, high contrast modes, and other accessibility features.
