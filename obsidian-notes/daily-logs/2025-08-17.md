- Designed component architecture for voice, visual, and text interfaces
- Planned implementation approach for accessibility support

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (6/18 tasks)
- Task 0: Development Environment Setup
- Task 1: File System Manager Implementation
- Task 2: Screen Monitor Module
- Task 3: Learning Engine
- Task 4: Task Manager Module
- Task 5: Personal Knowledge Base
- Task 6: Personal Assistant Core Integration

### üîÑ In Progress (1/18 tasks)
- Task 7: Multi-Modal Interaction Support

### ‚è≥ Upcoming (11/18 tasks)
- Task 8: Tool Integration Hub
- Task 9: Privacy and Security Controls
- Task 10: Proactive Assistance Engine
- Tasks 11-18: Remaining implementation and testing

## Technical Progress

### Multi-Modal Interaction Components Designed
1. **Voice Processor**: Speech recognition and synthesis
2. **Screen Overlay**: Visual annotations and contextual displays
3. **Text Completion**: Intelligent text suggestions
4. **Accessibility Manager**: Screen reader and keyboard support
5. **Mode Manager**: Seamless interaction mode switching

### Architecture Decisions
- Local processing for privacy-sensitive operations
- Modular design for easy testing and maintenance
- Integration with existing Personal Assistant Core
- Accessibility-first approach for inclusive design

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)

### üéØ Task 7 Implementation
1. Implement VoiceProcessor class with speech recognition
2. Create ScreenOverlay system for visual feedback
3. Build TextCompletion engine with context awareness
4. Add AccessibilityManager for inclusive design
5. Integrate all components with Personal Assistant Core
6. Write comprehensive tests for multi-modal functionality

### üìä Progress Tracking
- Update Obsidian notes with implementation progress
- Document any architectural changes or decisions
- Track performance metrics and optimization needs
- Update requirements status as features are completed

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Multi-Modal Complexity
**Issue**: Coordinating voice, visual, and text interfaces seamlessly
**Solution**: Centralized ModeManager with context preservation

### Challenge: Accessibility Compliance
**Issue**: Ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all interaction modes
**Solution**: Accessibility-first design with platform-specific integrations

### Challenge: Performance Requirements
**Issue**: Real-time processing for voice and visual interfaces
**Solution**: Async processing with optimized algorithms

## Knowledge Base Updates
- All major components now documented in Obsidian
- Cross-references established between related components
- Progress tracking system operational
- Daily logging system established

## Metrics
- **Documentation**: 7 major documents created
- **Component Maps**: 2 detailed component maps
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive system established
- **Knowledge Base**: Fully operational with cross-references
