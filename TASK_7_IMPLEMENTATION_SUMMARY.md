  - Self-Improvement Agent: Registered handlers for code analysis, performance metrics, improvement cycles, and system status
  - Configured merge strategies and conflict resolution preferences

- **Context Synchronization Features**:
  - Automatic context broadcasting to subscribed agents
  - Conflict detection and resolution between agents
  - Access control validation for context sharing
  - Performance optimization with caching and batching
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Key Features Implemented

### Enhanced MCP Client (`app/mcp_client.py`)
```python
class MCPClient:
    - Connection management with auto-reconnect
    - Message sending with response waiting
    - Context broadcasting and synchronization
    - Task notification handling
    - Agent request/response management
    - Background heartbeat and reconnection monitoring
```

### Agent Context Synchronization (`app/agent_context_synchronizer.py`)
```python
class AgentContextSynchronizer:
    - Agent-specific context handlers
    - Conflict resolution with multiple strategies
    - Context access control and validation
    - Performance metrics and sync history
    - Integration with MCP system
```

### Agent Enhancements
- **AI Assistant Agent**: Enhanced with MCP integration, context awareness, and conversation synchronization
- **Self-Improvement Agent**: Enhanced with MCP integration, improvement cycle coordination, and analysis context sharing
- **Agent Registry**: Enhanced with MCP registration and routing capabilities

## Context Types Supported
- `CONVERSATION`: Conversation state and history
- `TASK_STATE`: Active task information and status
- `USER_SESSION`: User session data and preferences
- `PERFORMANCE_METRICS`: System performance data
- `CODE_ANALYSIS`: Code quality analysis results
- `IMPROVEMENT_CYCLE`: Improvement cycle status and coordination
- `SYSTEM_STATUS`: System health and status information
- `AGENT_CAPABILITIES`: Agent capability information

## Conflict Resolution Strategies
- `LATEST_WINS`: Most recent timestamp wins
- `MERGE_RECURSIVE`: Deep merge of context data
- `SOURCE_PRIORITY`: Source agent has priority
- `FIELD_LEVEL_MERGE`: Field-by-field conflict resolution
- `MANUAL_RESOLUTION`: Requires manual intervention

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite `tests/test_agent_mcp_integration.py` covering:
- MCP client initialization and configuration
- Agent context creation and validation
- Message handling and routing
- Context synchronization and conflict resolution
- Agent startup sequences
- Performance metrics tracking

## Integration Points
- **MCP Integration**: Full integration with enhanced MCP server infrastructure
- **Context Synchronizer**: Integration with existing context synchronization system
- **Agent Registry**: Enhanced registry with MCP-aware agent management
- **Redis Backend**: Leverages Redis for message queuing and persistence

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ **2.1**: Agents establish MCP client connections to server
- ✅ **2.2**: Agents format messages according to MCP protocol standards
- ✅ **2.3**: Agents process and integrate context information appropriately
- ✅ **2.4**: Agents handle connection failures gracefully with retry logic
- ✅ **2.5**: Context sharing capabilities added to existing agents
- ✅ **2.6**: Agent-specific context update handlers implemented
- ✅ **7.1**: Context broadcasting system for agent communication
- ✅ **7.2**: Context versioning and conflict detection
- ✅ **7.3**: Context merge and resolution strategies

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app/mcp_client.py` - Enhanced MCP client for agent communication
- `app/agent_context_synchronizer.py` - Agent-specific context synchronization
- `tests/test_agent_mcp_integration.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for integration testing. The next tasks in the sequence would be:
- Task 8: Create Git Workflow Automation Service
- Task 9: Add Performance Optimization and Monitoring
- Task 10: Implement Error Handling and Recovery Systems

## Dependencies
The implementation requires the following Python packages:
